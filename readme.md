# JavaScript30

Following my completion of the General Assembly Software Engineering Imersive course, I wanted to keep working on my technical skills whilst updating my job search tools. See below for my lessons learnt coding along with Wes's **JavaScript30** and check GitHub for my completed solutions.

## Lessons Learnt

### Day 1 - JavaScript Drum Kit
A fun little project, my kids are going to love. A good revision session about DOM interaction and event listeners. Today I learned about data-* attributes on HTML elements, the ability to embed custom attributes and the ability to listen for transition end events.

### Day 2 - JS and CSS Clock
Surprisingly quick to complete and hypnotising to watch. I've always found dates in JS quite tiresome so nice to have a good experience and build some more knowledge. Today I learned more about transition and transform attributes in CSS and actually how much fancy stuff can be achieved through CSS and vanilla JavaScript alone. 

### Day 3 - CSS Variables
Funky little project to learn about CSS variables, which I had no idea even existed outside of SASS. Today I learnt the difference between a node list and an array (spoiler: built-in methods) [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_nodelist.asp). I also learnt about 'dataset', an in-built object that stores info about all the data-* attributes on a HTML element.

### Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1
Wow! This day definitely felt more intense. Really flexing those ES6 muscles. A great lesson, the first time I encountered array methods I freaked but since then I've discovered how amazingly useful they are. This session was a great refresher and pushed my understanding much further. Firstly, console.table... life-changer. Secondly, I never truly understood the breadth of tasks .reduce could be used for, so good to go through these additional examples. I also learned some handy formatting for stringing together array methods to make my code more readable. [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp).

### Day 5 - Flex Panel Gallery
A really beautiful project, with a feel-good outcome. Today I learned how little I utilise the various different CSS selectors and got some inspiration for future projects. CSS Diner is great site for practising [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/), a good reminder about toggling Class names in the DOM also.

### Day 6 - Type Ahead
A lot to get my head round today. Heavier on the array methods and just a bit more complicated linking everything together. Today I learnt more about regular expressions which have always felt a little bit like black magic to me. I didn't know 'g' was global and that 'i' was insensitive. [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp). I think I'll need to spend some more time reviewing this mini-project. It's very impressive what can be achieved with data found on the internet though!!

### Day 7 - Array Cardio Day 2
Definitely feeling the Codewars vibe with today's session. I've never used any of these array method before so lots learned! Also building my knowledge of when it's appropriate to use the spread operator (so often! It's an incredibly useful critter).
