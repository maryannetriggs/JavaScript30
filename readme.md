## Lessons Learnt

### Day 1 - JavaScript Drum Kit
A fun little project, my kids are going to love. A good revision session about DOM interaction and event listeners. Today I learned about data-* attributes on HTML elements, the ability to embed custom attributes and the ability to listen for transition end events.

### Day 2 - JS and CSS Clock
Surprisingly quick to complete and hypnotising to watch. I've always found dates in JS quite tiresome so nice to have a good experience and build some more knowledge. Today I learned more about transition and transform attributes in CSS and actually how much fancy stuff can be achieved through CSS and vanilla JavaScript alone. 

### Day 3 - CSS Variables
Funky little project to learn about CSS variables, which I had no idea even existed outside of SASS. Today I learnt the difference between a node list and an array (spoiler: built-in methods) [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_nodelist.asp). I also learnt about 'dataset', an in-built object that stores info about all the data-* attributes on a HTML element.

### Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1
Wow! This day definitely felt more intense. Really flexing those ES6 muscles. A great lesson, the first time I encountered array methods I freaked but since then I've discovered how amazingly useful they are. This session was a great refresher and pushed my understanding much further. Firstly, console.table... life-changer. Secondly, I never truly understood the breadth of tasks .reduce could be used for, so good to go through these additional examples. I also learned some handy formatting for stringing together array methods to make my code more readable. [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp).

### Day 5 - Flex Panel Gallery
A really beautiful project, with a feel-good outcome. Today I learned how little I utilise the various different CSS selectors and got some inspiration for future projects. CSS Diner is great site for practising [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/), a good reminder about toggling Class names in the DOM also.

### Day 6 - Type Ahead
A lot to get my head round today. Heavier on the array methods and just a bit more complicated linking everything together. Today I learnt more about regular expressions which have always felt a little bit like black magic to me. I didn't know 'g' was global and that 'i' was insensitive. [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp). I think I'll need to spend some more time reviewing this mini-project. It's very impressive what can be achieved with data found on the internet though!!

### Day 7 - Array Cardio Day 2
Definitely feeling the Codewars vibe with today's session. I've never used any of these array method before so lots learned! Also building my knowledge of when it's appropriate to use the spread operator (so often! It's an incredibly useful critter).

### Day 8 - Fun with HTML5 Canvas
I've been hoping to get some experience playing with Canvas and this only makes me want to explore more. A great little project playing with colours (hsl) and integrating some more JS logic into making a usable application. I'd like to spend more time investigating what Canvas can do but today I learnt the basics of set up and also practiced using boolean operators in real life! [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_canvas.asp)

### Day 9 - Dev Tools Domination
Well, Wes said we'd learn 1 or 2 things but I found a whole new world with console methods. Discovering the attribute modification option to discover sneaky hidden JS in your webpage was a game changer along with console.group [Link to the MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/group) (which indents following console messages by group) and console.dir (which displays the available properties and methods available for use on the selected object) [Link to the MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console/dir)

### Day 10 - Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes
An interesting little play around with event listeners and logic. I'll admit I couldn't complete this one without the instructions. No really new concepts for me but so good to have a fresh example of putting all these simple concepts together. Pulled together use of the DOM, event listeners, functions, variables and logic statements.

### Day 11 - Custom Video Player

A huge chunk of a project which took a loooong time but I tried to work through the problems on my own before following the tutorial as Wes had suggested. More practice with event listeners and functions and especially with the HTML video tag and the various properties. Proud of this one!

### Day 12 - Key Sequence Detection

Short and sweet. A quick reminder of the joy of array methods and that I need more practice with them! Loved the Cornify function, absolutely brilliant! [cornify.com](https://www.cornify.com/)

### Day 13 - Slide in on Scroll

A maths heavy lesson, which I love. I've always wanted to know how this image effect was created and love how simple it is. The debounce function was a little confusing but revising the classList 'add' and 'remove' methods was useful. 

### Day 14 - JavaScript References VS Copying

A useful reminder of the behaviour of mutable and immutable objects within JavaScript. Nice to see that the ES6 spread operator has now come to objects as well as arrays. Need to keep this lesson in mind for my future projects. [Link to the MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Mutable)

### Day 15 - Local Storage

A real busy and challenging project today. I learned loads including the difference between click and submit cues for event listeners [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp), that forms have an inbuilt reset method and that you can cleverly customise your own checklist styling using pseudoclasses within CSS [Link to the MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes). I also gained a clearer understanding on why we target the parent element when using event listeners (event delegation), particularly enjoyed the analogy for this too 😂

### Day 16 - Mouse Move Shadow

A neat little trick learned today, further impressing on me how much can be achieved with CSS. A good reminder of the Math object and its many methods [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp) plus lots more practice with the x and y mouse events. I love a maths heavy session so this was really enjoyable for me.

### Day 17 - Sort Without Articles

A really useful session. Good practice with regular expressions and learning how to manipulate your data into the format you require before you work with it [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_regexp.asp). I've also learned how much I enjoy simplifying logic using ternary operators.

### Day 18 - Adding Up Times with Reduce

A good practical lesson, less flashy but super useful. Today I was reminded of the use of Array.from and the differences between node lists and arrays. I also revised how some methods (e.g. split) create fun problems with datatypes and I learned a novel use of the modulus operator. A good solid lesson!

### Day 19 - Webcam Fun

Seemed like a pretty intense undertaking upon first inspection but accessing the webcam with JavaScript is easy! You call getUserMedia() to get a promise and then manipulate as you please. Funky 'filter' effects can then be achieved by accessing and changing pixel configurations in canvas [Link to the MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Pixel_manipulation_with_canvas). Today was a longer session than most but well worth the extra time. This one is really going to impress my kids!

### Day 20 - Speech Detection

Today's session was SO MUCH FUN! Once again an idea I had no idea would be so simple to actually implement - voice recognition within the browser [Link to the MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) .Some good use of JS array methods, event listeners and DOM manipulation  with some bonus handling of nested data. Super quick and fun session, learned loads, perfect!

### Day 21 - Geolocation

Where to start with this one?! No idea you could simulate how code runs on various iOS devices with Xcode, really cool! I need to look more into this. Also a good brush up on using package managers like yarn and npm. Must checkout yarn 2 sometime... Aside from that, real simple JS today, the CSS once again making such an impact. Nice intro to the inbuilt navigator object too [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_navigator.asp).

### Day 22 - Follow Along Link Highlighter
This project is super pretty and snappy. I had completely forgotten the DOM append child method, great to go through again [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_node_appendchild.asp). Also, the getBoundingClientRect() method was a revelation! How useful is this going to be?!

### Day 23 - Speech Synthesis

Another fun day playing with speech within the browser. Today I learned more about the Web Speech API, including configuration of language and pitch and particularly about speech synthesis. Another little lesson was how useful anonymous functions can be to prevent event listener running on page load [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_definition.asp).

### Day 24 - Sticky Nav

Cute little piece of functionality learned today, animation of the nav bar on scroll. Good use of the .offsetHeight property on HTML elements to ensure smooth transitions when changing the CSS position property to fixed [Link to the MDN page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/offsetHeight).

### Day 25 - Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling and Once

More of an informative session today. Learning the ins and outs of event listeners [Link to the w3schools page](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp). Specifically propagation and bubbling, beautifully explained here [Link to the javscript.info page](https://javascript.info/bubbling-and-capturing). A really good explanation of the once property and a good case use of when you'd only want an event listener to fire off one time only (online checkouts).

### Day 26 - Stripe Follow Along Nav

Lovely feature learned today. A follow-along auto-resizing navigation-menu amazing-thing! Another reminder of how useful CSS can be and how simply event listeners can add gorgeous features to your work. A similar lesson to the Follow Along Link Highlighter lesson but something I could see implementing in my own work. No new material covered but a lot of concepts put together.

###¢ Day 27 - Click and Drag
